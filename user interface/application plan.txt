we need a swing window to insert data into database for table gallery 
spring will not be used, will use regular java swing.
need connection to database list of gallery names, only column gallery name
we will need also connection to database 
need have one select choice then text field with gallery name
then field type of gallery input text 
and one submit button 
then successfull or fail message

data connection messages: if database not found, refused connection, failed inserting data into database 


after user opens jar file woindow showes up, with database success or fail message, if fail message then we need message to check database connection,
if connected, user can get list of gallery names. need to make also find gallery name in case there is too many records, and pagination with limot of 10.
when user click on some of the gallery names, it will open new window with insert new type of gallery.. Then it will for each button open new woindow. 

Update or delete will only have options for type of gallery not allery name!!! Gallery name will be read only.
